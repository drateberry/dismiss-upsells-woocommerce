Remove the WooCommerce Marketplace upsells introduced in version 3.6

### Dismiss Suggestions for WooCommerce
This plugin removes the upsells for Automattic's WooCommerce plugin from your WordPress website. In Version 3.6 of WooCommerce, links to the WooCommerce Marketplace (operated by Automattic) are included on product admin pages.

Remove Upsells for WooCommerce will permanently disable marketplace suggestions instead of the native requirement to dismiss the upsell notifications daily for 5 days each month.

1. Activate the Dismiss Upsells for WooCommerce plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
